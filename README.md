## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   SCSS / SASS
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
-   [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

The project tested my knowledge of React and strengthened some essential aspects of React's hooks, such as useState() and useEffect() while implementing it and solving the requirements.
It was also challenging to organize the general styling of the project in a way that could be optimal for the layout and the code structure.
It was a great test that made me want to keep challenging myself and improve even further.
